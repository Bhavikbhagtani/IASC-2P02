## Wires, Everywhere

It was a rainy day and Juan was ready to go out with his friends to hangout at a coffee shop, but he could not find his aux cable to listen to his favorite songs while driving. There was a pile of wires and cables in his room and still, he could not find the one he needed. Juan left without the cable and had to listen to the radio thinking if only he could connect his phone wirelessly. Juan loved listening to music and aspires to be a music producer one day. He arrived at the coffee shop and met up with his friends and found out that one of his friends had accidentally taken his cable home.

“Hey Juan, here is your aux cable. Sorry, I accidentally took it the last time I was in your car.”, said Mark.

“It’s ok, thanks for returning it!”, Juan replied.

After the meet up they all went home. Juan opened up his window to appreciate the earthy aroma after the April shower, took out his earphones and started cleaning his room. Carol, Juan’s mother, called out his name several times until he heard her and came running down for dinner but as soon as Juan started running out of his room he tripped onto his wires and fell on his hand. Juan’s mother came up hearing the sound of Juan falling and immediately took him to the doctor as Juan had hurt his arm badly.

The doctor said “It is just a mild fracture you don’t need to worry about it, he will be fine if you take proper care of it for a month” as he put on the plaster on Juan’s hand. They went home and Juan was scolded for not keeping his wires properly. A month had passed, Juan opened up the box of wires his mother stowed away looking for another aux cable as the wire he had been using was not working properly.

“Mom! do you know where the other aux cable is?”, he asked his mother.

“It should be in the box of wires, if not then you may have to go and get another one.”, his mother replied.

“What happened to the cable you were using?”, Juan’s mom questioned as he was heading out to get another one.

“That cable is not working properly for some reason.”, Juan replied.

“Is it because the cover broke from the top yesterday?”, his mother asked.

“It could be because of that, I will try and see if it works right now and if it does not then I’ll get another one.”, Juan said.

“Ok, stay safe honey!” his mom said as Juan went out the door.

Juan took out his earphones, connected them to his phone and drove to the electronics store which was 30 minutes away from his house. After he got to the shop, he found out that it was closed and got really upset. He drove home but as he was driving back his earphone’s wire kept coming in the way of driving because of which Juan almost crashed and got himself injured again. He took off the earphones and got home safely shortly after. Juan was tired of having wires everywhere.

“Ugh, wires, everywhere! If only I could cut the wires and still listen to music.”, he said to himself. 

Juan woke up the next day and made a decision to not have any distractions while driving as it might get him badly injured one day. He started making his own music in his room and began his journey as a music producer.


## Micro Essay

The above is a speculative fiction set in an imaginary version of 2015. In this imaginative version, a piece of technology that is used in everyday life by people has never been invented. The main character of this story is tired of having wires to listen to music which he is most passionate about as Bluetooth is yet to be discovered in this version. The boy runs into problems because he has to deal with wires and wonders if only there was a way to cut the middleman. The key moment is the oldness of the new media which is Bluetooth is a big part of our lives. Bluetooth has been around for quite a while now and is being used in a lot of different new media such as connecting wirelessly to our car and earphones to accept calls and listen to music. Bluetooth is considered as old media, but this old media is being rediscovered into new media via other latest technology. If Bluetooth was not a thing in this generation then people would not be able to share media and connect wirelessly to any other device with ease. Jussi Parikka mentioned that “They are continuously remediated, resurfacing, finding new uses, contexts, adaptations.”. The story engages with this quote as Bluetooth is always being remediated and resurfaced through the latest headphones, smartphones, smart cars, etc. and will probably continue to remediate until another type of wireless connection is discovered. Bluetooth has slowly changed our lives since the beginning and has made it a lot easier. “New media might be here and slowly changing our user habits, but old media never left us.”, Parikka says. This quote tells us that even though Bluetooth is old media it still has not left us and changes our user habits as it is remediated into new media. The story depicts these concepts and engages us into critical and abstract thinking by showing us the connection between new and old media.
